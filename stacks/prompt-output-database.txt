Explanation of the Main Template

    AWSTemplateFormatVersion: Specifies the version of the CloudFormation template format.
    Description: A brief description of what the template does.
    Resources: This section defines the resources that will be created.
        InventoryItemsTable: This is the main DynamoDB table resource.
            AttributeDefinitions: Defines the attributes used in the table and indexes.
            KeySchema: Specifies the primary key for the table.
            ProvisionedThroughput: Sets the read and write capacity units for the table and indexes.
            GlobalSecondaryIndexes: Defines the GSIs for searching by PartNumberOrDesc, Name, and StatusID.
    Outputs: This section provides outputs that can be useful after the stack is created, such as the name of the DynamoDB table.

Note

    Adjust the ReadCapacityUnits and WriteCapacityUnits based on your expected workload and access patterns.
    If you plan to use on-demand capacity mode instead of provisioned capacity, you can remove the ProvisionedThroughput sections and set BillingMode: PAY_PER_REQUEST for the table and indexes.



Explanation of the Status and Location Sections

    StatusTable: This resource creates the Status table.
        AttributeDefinitions: Defines the StatusID attribute.
        KeySchema: Specifies StatusID as the partition key.
        ProvisionedThroughput: Sets the read and write capacity units for the table.

    LocationTable: This resource creates the Location table.
        AttributeDefinitions: Defines the LocationID attribute.
        KeySchema: Specifies LocationID as the partition key.
        ProvisionedThroughput: Sets the read and write capacity units for the table.

    Outputs: Additional outputs are provided for the Status and Location tables, allowing you to easily reference their names after the stack is created.

Note

    Adjust the ReadCapacityUnits and WriteCapacityUnits based on your expected workload and access patterns for all tables.
    If you prefer on-demand capacity mode, you can remove the ProvisionedThroughput sections and set BillingMode: PAY_PER_REQUEST for each table.
