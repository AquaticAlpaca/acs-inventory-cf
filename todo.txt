Test:

The API Gateway needs a stage
, but stage access needs to be limited
, so I need to know what domain requests will come from

Toward that end, I need to deploy a static website to S3
 - Define a new HTML form template that can call the API Gateway
 - Define a new Cloudformation template to deploy the HTML to S3, and define a static S3 website
 - Use the new host name in the API Gateway stage allowed-hosts (or other policy as needed)


Troubleshooting:
 When testing the newly-uploaded website, I click the "Send Request" button and get the response "Error: NetworkError when attempting to fetch resource."
 - Because CORS is not configured
