Problem:

The stack deploys a new copy of the website every time it is created
 - I want the site to be deployed only when it dooesn't already exists, but
 - Cloudformation doesn't provide a way to check this

So, split the website into its own stack. Deploy it separately from the rest of the infrastructure

Benefit: now we can specify the URL in one-read.py only once and expect it not to change.
